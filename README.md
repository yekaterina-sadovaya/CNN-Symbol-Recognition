## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model for ethiopit digits recognition

### Data

This solution was developed for the Kaggle competition. The dataset is a synthetic MNIST-style dataset, which can be dowloaded from the competiotion's page https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tau-ethiopic-digit-recognition/data. More details regarding the data can be found in the paper [1].
